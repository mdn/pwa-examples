# PWA Examples

Examples for progressive web apps.

In this repo, we currently have:

* [a2hs](a2hs): An example set up to show how Add to home screen (A2HS) works. [See it live here](https://mdn.github.io/pwa-examples/a2hs/). This includes an icon and [manifest file](a2hs/manifest.webmanifest) for allowing the app to be added to home screen, and a [simple service worker](a2hs/sw.js) for making the site work offline.

* [js13kpwa](js13kpwa): A list of A-Frame entries submitted to the js13kGames 2017 competition, used as an example for the MDN articles about Progressive Web Apps. The js13kPWA have the App Shell structure, works offline with the Service Worker, is installable thanks to the Manifest file and Add to Homescreen feature, and is re-engageable by using Notifications and Push. [See it live here](https://mdn.github.io/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/).
